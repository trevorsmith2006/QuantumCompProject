# QuantumCompProject
Quantum mechanics computational project for PHYS 472 Spring 2020. 

For this project we will design and implement a basic numerical integration scheme for the Time Independent Schroedinger
Equation (TISE) in one dimension. Using this scheme we will calculate the approximate wavefunctions and energy levels
for a particle of one electron-mass in some simple, 1D potentials that are otherwise difficult (or impossible) to solve
for analytically.

This project is coded in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, which provides a human readable script with embedded discussion.
